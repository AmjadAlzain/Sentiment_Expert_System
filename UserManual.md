### 1. Introduction

Welcome to the User Manual for the Shopee Review Sentiment Analysis Expert System. This document provides all the necessary information to understand and operate this modern web-based prototype.

The system is a rule-based expert system designed to analyze product reviews. Its primary goal is to automatically classify sentiment not only as a whole (Positive, Negative, Neutral) but also for specific **product aspects** such as Quality, Shipping, or Authenticity. The entire application runs directly in your web browser, requiring no complex setup.

### 2. System Requirements

* A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge).
* That's it! No other software is needed.

### 3. Installation Guide

There is no installation required. The entire application is contained within a single file.

1.  Ensure you have the `app.html` file on your computer.
2.  You are now ready to use the system.

### 4. How to Use the System

1.  Locate the `app.html` file on your computer using your File Explorer.
2.  **Double-click** the `app.html` file.
3.  The application will open in your default web browser.
4.  Once open, type or paste a product review into the main text box.
5.  Click the **"Analyze Sentiment"** button to see the results. You can also click the example buttons to test the system with pre-filled reviews.

### 5. Interpreting the Output

The system provides a structured analysis in a clear, visual format:

* **Overall Sentiment**: A prominent card at the top shows the summary of the entire review's sentiment, with a score and a label (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
* **Aspect Sentiments**: A detailed breakdown of sentiment for each product feature identified. Each aspect is displayed with its own score, label, and a progress bar indicating its sentiment strength.
* **Reasoning**: A step-by-step list explaining the rules and keywords the system used to arrive at its conclusions. This demonstrates the system's transparency.
